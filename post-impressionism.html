       <h1 class="subtitle"> What is Post-Impressionism?</h1>
       <div class="text">
        Post-Impressionism is an art movement that developed in the 1890s. It is characterized by a subjective approach to painting, as artists opted to evoke emotion rather than realism in their work. Post-Impressionism is a term used to describe the reaction in the 1880s against Impressionism. It was led by Paul Cézanne, Paul Gauguin, Vincent van Gogh and Georges Seurat. The Post-Impressionists rejected Impressionism’s concern with the spontaneous and naturalistic rendering of light and color. Instead they favored an emphasis on more symbolic content, formal order and structure. Similar to the Impressionists, however, they stressed the artificiality of the picture. The Post-Impressionists also believed that color could be independent from form and composition as an emotional and aesthetic bearer of meaning.

         <em>“Color! What a deep and mysterious language, the language of dreams.” </em>- Paul Gauguin
<br>
<br>
Unlike the Impressionists who strived to capture natural light’s affect on tonality, Post-Impressionists purposely employed an artificial color palette as a way to portray their emotion-drive perceptions of the world around them. Saturated hues, multicolored shadows, and rich ranges of color are evident in most Post-Impressionist paintings, proving the artists’ innovative and imaginative approach to representation.

       <h2 class="little-subtitle">Distinctive Brushstrokes </h2>
       <div class="text">
            Van Gogh was known for his thick application of paint on canvas, called impasto. An Italian word for 'paste' or 'mixture', impasto is used to describe a painting technique where paint (usually oil) is laid on so thickly that the texture of brush strokes or palette knife are clearly visible.
            <br>
            In addition to adding texture and a sense of depth to a work of art, these marks also point to the painterly qualities of the piece, making it clear that it is not intended to be a realistic representation of its subject.
